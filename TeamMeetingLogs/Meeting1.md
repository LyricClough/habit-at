Notes for directions of improvement (meeting 1):

Pie charts on homepage? Could be a good idea, if not then choose
specific duolingo UI

Make vision for calendar better, right now it might be cluttered

> \- Maybe use a month/day/week format that expands when a specific
> week/day is clicked on?
>
> \- Calendar should be used to (re)schedule notifications

Stats page

> \- Stats page should show basically everything - Categories
>
> \- Completion rates/streaks
>
> \- Some kind of “compare with friend” feature for a social aspect -
> Farm analytics based on the times a habit has been followed up on
>
> \- Popup notifications based on analytics
>
> \- Could be done through text notifications, could just be done on the
> site - The latter is good for UI points
>
> \- Habits would be need to be marked complete periodically
>
> \- This would be better as a mobile app, but we’re making a proof of
> concept so whatever

Settings

> \- General for site functionality stuff
>
> \- Data for data collection settings(?) - Manage habits is
> self-explanatory

Misc:

For email notifications (which is what we’re realistically going with)
add a “test email” button to confirm that the API works.
